# Meal Box

This is an application I made for my personal use and to learn *flutter* and *firebase*.
In this application there are 3 pages.
1. **Home Page:** 
On this page I can see all the tiffin data of every month. This data includes total bill of the month and the whether the due bill is paid or not.

2. **Add Tiffin:**
On this page I can add new tiffin by selecting the date and appropriate fields. Then the data will be added into *Cloud Firestore*.

3. **Month Detail:**
On this page I can see all the detail data of a month. I can change the status of bill payment of that month. Also can delete any tiffin.
